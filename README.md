# Questionable

### AJ Fabry, Will Hefferman, and Graham Shroyer

Users ask questions. They can ask any question they want, no topics, no categories.
Just a list of questions to scroll through. They can rate other user’s questions as good or bad,
and also answer other user’s questions, but they have to answer in the form of a question. This
creates a whole thread of questions. Users can sort by best questions or new questions.
